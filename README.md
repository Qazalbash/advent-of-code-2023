Welcome to my repository where I share my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and challenge types.

## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository represents a day of the challenge, containing my solutions and notes for that day's puzzles.

```bash
aoc-sols
â”œâ”€â”€ year
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dayN
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## How to Run the Solutions

```bash
cd year/dayN
cargo test
```
