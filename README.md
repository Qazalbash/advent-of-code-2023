# ðŸŽ„ [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)

Welcome to my repository where I share my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and challenge types.

## About Me

I am Meesum Qazalbash, a passionate coder and problem-solver. I enjoy taking on new challenges and continuously learning. Participating in Advent of Code is part of my journey to enhance my programming skills and have some fun along the way!

## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository represents a day of the challenge, containing my solutions and notes for that day's puzzles.

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ dayN
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Technologies Used

-   **Programming Language:** Rust
<!-- -   **Tools and Libraries:**  -->

## Highlights

-   **Day 1:** First part was easy but figuring out the second part was bit tricky.
-   **Day 2:** Problems were trivial. But Rust syntax took alot of time for me to figure out.

## How to Run the Solutions

```bash
cd dayN
cargo test
```
